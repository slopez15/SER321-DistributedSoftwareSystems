Music Player Desktop Application

This application displays my understanding of:

Java and C++ object oriented programming, 
building with Ant and Make, 
serialization (object stream), 
(JSON) JavaScript Object Notation, 
networking (general form:: protocol://user@host:port/path?query#fragment) and sockets (form:: inetAddr:port) (sockets have input and output streams) (ex: Datagram, Stream (ex:Buffer, Data, Object) (for  binary, text, and string data or serialized), Raw), protocols (http, ftp, smtp, telnet, mailto, file, orb), 
JAVA (RMI) Remote Method Invocation and C++ (RPC) Remote Procedure Call, 
(GUI) Graphical User Interface with (FLTK) Fast Light Toolkit or Full-Tick for C++ and Swing for Java 
with (MVC) Model–view–controller software architectural pattern, Runtime Environment, 
threads (to be developed) and scaling.
